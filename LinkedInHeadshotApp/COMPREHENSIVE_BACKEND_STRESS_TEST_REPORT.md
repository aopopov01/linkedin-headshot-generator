#### 2. Image Processing Pipeline Broken
- **Issue:** "Input buffer contains unsupported image format" errors
- **Impact:** Core functionality (image optimization) completely non-functional
- **Root Cause:** Image processor cannot handle certain image formats
- **Fix Required:** Robust image format validation and conversion

### ⚠️ High Priority

#### 3. Missing External API Configurations
- **Issue:** API integration layer reporting missing configurations
- **Impact:** External AI services unavailable
- **Services Affected:** Replicate, OpenAI, Stability AI, Cloudinary
- **Fix Required:** Configure API keys and service endpoints

#### 4. Cost Estimation Service Failure
- **Issue:** Cost estimation endpoint returning 500 errors
- **Impact:** Users cannot get pricing information
- **Fix Required:** Debug cost calculation service dependencies

       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
       services: {
         api: 'healthy',
         database: checkDatabase(),
         // Don't include failing services in basic health
       }
     });
   });
   ```

2. **Fix Image Processing**
