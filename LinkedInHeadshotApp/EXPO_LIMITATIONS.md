# Expo Development Limitations & Solutions

## Media Library Access Warning

**Warning**: Due to changes in Android's permission requirements, Expo Go can no longer provide full access to the media library on Android devices.

### Impact
- Image downloading to Photos may be limited or fail on Android when using Expo Go
- Custom album creation ("LinkedIn Headshots" album) may not work
- iOS devices and development builds are not affected

## Solutions

### Option 1: Development Build (Recommended for Production)
Create a development build for full functionality:
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login to Expo
eas login

# Configure build
eas build:configure

# Create development build
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

### Option 2: Use iOS for Testing
- Full media library access works perfectly on iOS devices
- All features including custom album creation work as intended

### Option 3: Web Version
Consider testing the web version for development:
```bash
npm run web
```

## Current App Behavior

### Graceful Degradation
- App detects when media library access is limited
- Shows helpful error messages with solutions
- Provides links to documentation
- Image is still saved to Photos (just not in custom album)

### User-Friendly Messages
- Clear explanations of limitations
- Links to development build documentation
- Alternative solutions provided

## API Updates Applied

### Fixed Deprecated API
Updated from deprecated `ImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images` to `ImagePicker.MediaType.Images`

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Better permission error messages
- Fallback behavior when album creation fails
- Links to solutions and documentation

## Production Deployment

For production apps, use:
1. **EAS Build** for native app deployment
2. **Development builds** during development
3. **Expo Go** only for basic prototyping

This ensures full media library access and all features work correctly.
