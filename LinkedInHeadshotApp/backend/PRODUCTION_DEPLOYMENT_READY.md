## 🚀 Quick Start Production Deployment

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Set production environment
export NODE_ENV=production
export PORT=3000

# Install dependencies
npm install --production

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### 2. Start Production Server
```bash
# Using the optimized server
node performance-optimized-server.js

# Or use PM2 for production
pm2 start performance-optimized-server.js --name "omnishot-backend"
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Performance metrics
curl http://localhost:3000/api/metrics

# Service health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/services/health
```
